# Naraka Bladepoint Ultimate Bravery Bot
- The idea stems from Ultimate Bravery from League of Legends back around Seasons 3-4. The concept is
    to randomize your character, items to use/buy and skills to use. For League it was summoner skills
    for Naraka the concept would be Character, Skill variant, ultimate variant and the weapons to prioritize.
    The base rarity that would make sense is Rare (Blue). If you find a blue weapon of the one you need to prioritize,
    you use that over any other weapon, even if it's a gold of another - parries excluded but you still need to attempt to pick the weapon back up when possible.
- There are some improvements that need to be done, such as some characters that used to have 3 skills have now gone down to 2, so the bot currently doesn't handle
    situations of that. I also want to imrpove the way I get the randomized values but it works currently the way it is.
